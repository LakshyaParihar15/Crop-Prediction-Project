ðŸ‘‰ [Crop Prediction Web App](https://crop-predication-lgkr.onrender.com)

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input soil and environmental parameters through a simple web form.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Receive immediate crop recommendations based on input data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained model to predict the best-suited crop.
- **Web Deployment**: Built with Flask, HTML, and CSS for seamless web integration.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input Parameters

Users are required to input the following features:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH
- Rainfall (mm)

These inputs are then passed through a trained model which returns the most suitable crop for the given conditions.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used for training is `Crop_recommendation.csv`, which contains:

- **Features**: N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall
- **Target**: Crop name

ðŸ“Œ **Source**: [Kaggle - Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aksahaha/crop-recommendation)

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Training (Optional)

If you'd like to retrain the machine learning model using the dataset:

```bash```
python "Crop Recommendation.py"

This script will generate a new model.pkl file based on the training data.

## ðŸ§° Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

All dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
